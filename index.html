<h1>Gregory M. Kurtzer</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
My career started in the mid-1990's with a degree in biochemistry and a
strong passion for open source software and Linux. Coupling these
displinces landed me squarely in High Performance Computing (HPC) where I've
spent well over two decades working with scientists and researchers to solve
some of the hardest and biggest computational problems ever.
</p>
<p>
While in this role I also created several widely utilized open source
projects that even furthered my ability to help support scientific
innovation.
</p>
<p>
In 2017 I left the DOE to further enable both researchers as well as 
enterprise organizations and I have now founded and led two companies
as CEO, Sylabs and now CIQ.

<h2>Open Source Projects</h2>

<h3>OpenELA</h3>
<p>
OpenELA is a non-profit trade association including CIQ, Oracle, and SuSE. The
goal is to ensure the longevity and continunity of Enterpise Linux such that
downstream derivitives can always provide a stable community based solution.

<h3>Rocky Linux</h3>
<p>
Due to a recent shift in direction, Centos Linux is no longer a viable alternative
for many organizations and enterprises (including my own needs). So I started
another Linux distribution targetted at solving the same problem that Centos
was designed to solve.

<h3>Singularity / Apptainer</h3>
<p>
In 2015-2016, containers were all the rage and thety took the industry by storm.
Unfortunately, containers were not well supported in HPC environments for a variety
of reasons. I set out to solve this problem and created Singularity. Within 6-9
months from the initial release, Singularity was being used across the entire
computing industry because it solved such a massive pain point.
</p>
<p>
In 2021 I moved Singularity into the Linux Foundation and per their request, the
project was renamed to Apptainer.

<h3>Perceus</h3>
<p>
Warewulf took a brief hiatus while I further developed it's provisioning
functions under a new project (Perceus) and a corporate umbrella. After I
finished developing Perceus it was determined that the best path forward is
to continue with Warewulf using an open source (BSD) license under the
funding of Lawrence Berkeley National Labratory.
</p>

<h3>Centos</h3>
<p>
Centos came from the Caos Foundation (which I started in 2002) and
initially Centos was destined to be a build platform for the new RPM based
community maintained distribution Caos Linux. When it was designed to be
released to the public, it was originally coined as Caos-EL (Enterprise
Linux) and it was renamed publicly in December 2003 to what it is known
as today.
</p>
<p>
After founding the project I led it until 2005 and I was responsible for
all of it's initial leadership, management, public outreach and partnerships
during that period. Due to legal, political, and severely less then excellent
people, I was forced to relinquish leadership of the project to someone in
the UK (where it stayed until the core developers were able to regain control
of the project). There <i>might be</i> some very entertaining stories to be
shared over dinner and drinks among friends...
</p>
<p>
Before Red Hat killed off the project, CentOS was one of the most utilized
enterprise focused operating systems used across the ecosystem.

<h3>Warewulf</h3>
<p>
Warewulf is a scalable systems management suite originally developed to manage
large high-performance Linux clusters. Focused on general scalable systems
management, it includes a framework for system configuration, management,
provisioning/installation, monitoring, event notification, and more via a
modular plugin architecture. Install the components and features you need or
leverage the existing system configurations stored within Warewulf to create
custom solutions to meet your particular needs.
