<h1>Gregory M. Kurtzer</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Over my 20+ year career I have built a reputation as an industry leader,
creating new trends and being results focused while representing the best
interests of both the organization and those of my teams. In addition to my
professional career I also have created, founded and built several large
open source projects and communities in the open source realm with install
counts in the millions of users. These projects include CentOS Linux, Caos
Linux, Perceus, Warewulf and most recently Singularity. My core values
include honesty, ethics, and integrity; Standards in which I hold both
myself and my colleagues to.
</p>
<p>
Specialties: Linux (environment, services and deep system internals), open
source, HPC, clustering, MPI, provisioning, scalability, system
administration, architecture, automation, development (Perl, C, SQL, PHP,
HTML, etc.), recruiting, team leadership, project leadership, management and
public speaking.
</p>

<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>
I am the CEO of Ctrl IQ, Inc. and I'm hiring! Let me know if you are
interested and have a background in operating systems, containers, HPC,
and/or Kubernetes.
</p>

<h2>Open Source Projects</h2>
<p>
I have taken part of a variety of open source projects over the years, and
below are the ones I have had the honor of creating and leading and being
part of.
</p>

<h3>Rocky Linux</h3>
<p>
Due to a recent shift in direction, Centos Linux is no longer a viable alternative
for many organizations and enterprises (including my own needs). So I started
another Linux distribution targetted at solving the same problem that Centos
was designed to solve.
</p>

<h3>Singularity</h3>
<p>
Containers have taken the tech world by storm, and while they may be a
fantastic alternative to virtual machines (when the hardware abstraction is
not necessary), they are not a great fit for application portability. Until
now....
</p>
<p>
Singularity combines software packaging models (such as RPM) with
minimalistic containers to create very lightweight application bundles which
can be simply executed and contained completely within their environment or
be used to interact directly with the host file systems at native speeds.
</p>
<p>
A Singularity application bundle can be as simple as containing a single
binary application or as complicated as containing an entire workflow and
is as flexible as you will need.

<h3>Warewulf</h3>
<p>
Warewulf is a scalable systems management suite originally developed to manage
large high-performance Linux clusters. Focused on general scalable systems
management, it includes a framework for system configuration, management,
provisioning/installation, monitoring, event notification, and more via a
modular plugin architecture. Install the components and features you need or
leverage the existing system configurations stored within Warewulf to create
custom solutions to meet your particular needs.

</p>

<h3>Perceus</h3>
<p>
Warewulf took a brief hiatus while I further developed it's provisioning
functions under a new project (Perceus) and a corporate umbrella. After I
finished developing Perceus it was determined that the best path forward is
to continue with Warewulf using an open source (BSD) license under the
funding of Lawrence Berkeley National Labratory.
</p>

<h3>Centos</h3>
<p>
Centos came from the Caos Foundation (which I started in 2002) and
initially Centos was destined to be a build platform for the new RPM based
community maintained distribution Caos Linux. When it was designed to be
released to the public, it was originally coined as Caos-EL (Enterprise
Linux) and it was renamed publicly in December 2003 to what it is known
as today.
</p>
<p>
After founding the project I led it until 2005 and I was responsible for
all of it's initial leadership, management, public outreach and partnerships
during that period. Due to legal, political, and severely less then excellent
people, I was forced to relinquish leadership of the project to a party in
the UK (where it stayed until the core developers were able to regain control
of the project). There <i>might be</i> some very entertaining stories to be
shared over dinner and drinks among friends...
</p>
<p>
Now the project is one of the most utilized Linux distributions for servers
and is run by Red Hat.
